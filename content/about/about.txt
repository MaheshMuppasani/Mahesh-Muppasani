I have had hands-on experience of 3+ years in front-end development. My expertise includes developing static websites with vanilla javascript, scalable websites using JavaScript frameworks such as ReactJS, Angular and VueJS, etc. I built websites with responsiveness, mobile first, SEO optimized and high performance. My work includes utilizing APIS using either RESTful or GraphQL architecture.

I began my back-end development journey 1 year after my front-end mastery. I understood the ecosystem and road map of backend development. I then started learnining Node.js to build simple yet scalable backend applications. I leveraged the advantage of using serverside capabilities of JavaScript with various backend technologies such as Express.js, Socket.io and Graphql Server, SQL and MongoDB.

I always been a technology geek and feel something interesting about technology. I love the progress that our civilization achieved in software systems from the past few decades. Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence were a revolution in technology. Apart from building web applications I regularly follow other technologies such as developing GPTs with Open AI tools, Blogs on Web3 and Virtual Reality etc.
